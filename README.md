# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I'm Murat. I am studying at Karab√ºk University, Department of Computer Engineering and I am focused on improving myself in software development.

In order to be a successful software engineer, I pay attention to improve myself in different areas, follow development processes and be open to new technologies. For this reason, during my university education, I tried to improve myself in Web Development. Also, by taking part in open source projects, I both improved my own skills and contributed to the community.

My goals are to push myself to the next level in software development, keep up with new technologies and improve my leadership skills in the development process. To achieve these goals, I will continue to learn and improve myself.

On my GitHub profile, I share my work and you can learn more about my software development skills by checking out these projects.

Thanks, I'm always open to reach out to me!
